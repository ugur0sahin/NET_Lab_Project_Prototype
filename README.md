# NET_Lab_Project_v0.1.2
- The algorithm gives common nodes, edges and fused nodes, edges is encoded in the 

# NET_Lab_Project_v0.1.1
- Defined networkx databases can be manipulatd through directd randomization algorithm coded in generate_randirected_db.py, also can be plotted
- Different networkx defined databases corresponds (G1,G2..) can be project to fusion matrices that is generated from fused ndoe_lists
- Comparison algorithm is coded to compare_binary_interacted_networks.py script, projected Graphs can be compared in terms of it's edge_binarial identity.
- Compared graphs can be evaluated in the score functions that render with x**2

# NET_Lab_Project_v0.0.1
- The databases contains random nades are assigned to Networkx.
- Defined Networkx databases can be plotted through implied algorithm through matplotlib
